###Working of an optical Encoder

Two pulses whose phases are shifted by a quarter cycle are generated. These two pulses are generally called phase A and phase B. The rotational direction can be determined depending on which pulse of the phase A or phase B rises first. By subtracting the number of pulses in reverse rotation, the amount of rotation can be accurately determined even if the rotational direction changes.
